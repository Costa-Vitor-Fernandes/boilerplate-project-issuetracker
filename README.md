# Issue Tracker

  This is the boilerplate for the Issue Tracker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/issue-tracker




    Complete the necessary routes in /routes/api.js
    Create all of the functional tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js
    Copy the sample.env file to .env and set the variables appropriately
    To run the tests automatically, add NODE_ENV=test in your .env file
    To run the tests in the console, use the command npm run test

Write the following tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js:

    Create an issue with every field: POST request to /api/issues/{project}
    Create an issue with only required fields: POST request to /api/issues/{project}
    Create an issue with missing required fields: POST request to /api/issues/{project}
    View issues on a project: GET request to /api/issues/{project}
    View issues on a project with one filter: GET request to /api/issues/{project}
    View issues on a project with multiple filters: GET request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update one field on an issue: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update multiple fields on an issue: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update an issue with missing _id: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update an issue with no fields to update: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Update an issue with an invalid _id: PUT request to /api/issues/{project}
    Delete an issue: DELETE request to /api/issues/{project}
    Delete an issue with an invalid _id: DELETE request to /api/issues/{project}
    Delete an issue with missing _id: DELETE request to /api/issues/{project}

Tests

Passed: 1. You can provide your own project, not the example URL.

Passed: 2. You can send a POST request to /api/issues/{projectname} with form data containing the required fields issue_title, issue_text, created_by, and optionally assigned_to and status_text.

Passed: 3. The POST request to /api/issues/{projectname} will return the created object, and must include all of the submitted fields. Excluded optional fields will be returned as empty strings. Additionally, include created_on (date/time), updated_on (date/time), open (boolean, true for open - default value, false for closed), and _id.

Passed: 4. If you send a POST request to /api/issues/{projectname} without the required fields, returned will be the error { error: 'required field(s) missing' }

Passed: 5. You can send a GET request to /api/issues/{projectname} for an array of all issues for that specific projectname, with all the fields present for each issue.

Passed: 6. You can send a GET request to /api/issues/{projectname} and filter the request by also passing along any field and value as a URL query (ie. /api/issues/{project}?open=false). You can pass one or more field/value pairs at once.

Passed: 7. You can send a PUT request to /api/issues/{projectname} with an _id and one or more fields to update. On success, the updated_on field should be updated, and returned should be {  result: 'successfully updated', '_id': _id }.

Passed: 8. When the PUT request sent to /api/issues/{projectname} does not include an _id, the return value is { error: 'missing _id' }.

Passed: 9. When the PUT request sent to /api/issues/{projectname} does not include update fields, the return value is { error: 'no update field(s) sent', '_id': _id }. On any other error, the return value is { error: 'could not update', '_id': _id }.

Passed: 10. You can send a DELETE request to /api/issues/{projectname} with an _id to delete an issue. If no _id is sent, the return value is { error: 'missing _id' }. On success, the return value is { result: 'successfully deleted', '_id': _id }. On failure, the return value is { error: 'could not delete', '_id': _id }.

Passed: 11. All 14 functional tests are complete and passing.
